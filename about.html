<p> This website is a side-project of mine that I wanted to do for a while! I've been interested in
  expanding my skills and found that HTML is some low level coding I've been wanting to try
  since being a 6th grader.
</p>
<p>
  This website consists of documentation of projects that I've worked on, or have been working on my own time.
  It's an easy way to journal in my thoughts and goals for each individual project that I've started.
  Furthermore, the website itself is it's own project as I continue to learn HTML and change up and add more
  elements to this website.
